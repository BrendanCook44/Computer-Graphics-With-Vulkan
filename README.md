# Computer Graphics with Vulkan

This repository contains all projects & assignments associated with the completion of the **Computer Graphics with Vulkan** course.

The course covers modern Vulkan practices including GPU setup, rendering pipelines, command buffers, descriptor sets, swapchains, textures, and more using C++ and Vulkan.

## Topics

- Initialize Vulkan
- GPU Enumeration & Feature Selection
- Vulkan Validation Layers
- Surface Configuration
- Create and Manage a Swapchain
- Build a Graphics Pipeline with Shaders in SPIR-V
- Render Pass and Subpasses
- Command Buffers & Queues
- Loading Vertex and Index Data
- Descriptor Sets and Push Constants
- Depth Buffers
- Textures
- Import Models
- Multiple Subpasses and Input Attachments

## Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Visual Studio**  
- **MSVC Compiler**
- **Vulkan SDK 1.4+**

(All external libraries, SPIR-V shaders, and textures are already included in the repository.)
